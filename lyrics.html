        Yeah, I'm gonna take my horse to the old town road
        I'm gonna ride 'til I can't no more
        I'm gonna take my horse to the old town road
        I'm gonna ride 'til I can't no more (Kio, Kio)

        I got the horses in the back, horse tack is attached
        Hat is matte black, got the boots that's black to match
        Ridin' on a horse, ha, you can whip your Porsche
        I been in the valley, you ain't been up off that porch, now

        Can't nobody tell me nothin'
        You can't tell me nothin'
        Can't nobody tell me nothin'
        You can't tell me nothin'

        Ridin' on a tractor, lean all in my bladder
        Cheated on my baby, you can go and ask her
        My life is a movie, bull ridin' and boobies
        Cowboy hat from Gucci, Wrangler on my booty

        Can't nobody tell me nothin'
        You can't tell me nothin'
        Can't nobody tell me nothin'
        You can't tell me nothin'

        Yeah, I'm gonna take my horse to the old town road
        I'm gonna ride 'til I can't no more
        I'm gonna take my horse to the old town road
        I'm gonna ride 'til I can't no more
